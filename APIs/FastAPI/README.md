# Write about fastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It was created by Sebastián Ramírez and is designed to be easy to use while providing powerful features for building robust applications. Here are some key aspects of FastAPI:

Key Features
Fast Performance: FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks available, thanks to its asynchronous capabilities and the use of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation.

Automatic Interactive API Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc. This makes it easy for developers to test and the API endpoints.

Type Hints and Data Validation: FastAPI leverages Python's type hints to provide data validation and serialization. This means that you can define your data models using Pydantic, and FastAPI will automatically validate incoming requests.

Asynchronous Support: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, allowing you to write non-blocking code using async and await. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, such as database queries or API calls.

Dependency Injection: FastAPI has a built-in dependency injection system that allows you to manage dependencies in a clean and efficient way. This promotes modularity and reusability in code.

Security and Authentication: FastAPI provides tools for implementing security features, such as OAuth2, JWT tokens, and API key authentication, making it easier to secure your APIs.

Extensibility: FastAPI is designed to be extensible, allowing you to integrate with other libraries and frameworks easily. You can use it with ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Tortoise-ORM, or any other libraries you prefer.
