# What is Product Analytics -> Actual Product Usage to understand this real raw data

Product Instrumentaion : Structured Approach
  - what to track
  - how to tack it    -> for timely insights

# 1- What should build (If you are this phase of Product)
    # Every Product Idealization Comes from a Concept and 
        Concept Validation
            - Interviews
            - Surveys
            - Third surveys
        Product Instrunmentation at this level
        - Build a prototype load with track metrics to validate your idea.
    - Defining value Moments of the products
    - Find the value Moments
    - Guilding users to the your value moments

# - Who should I build it for
    Product Instrumentation
    - Analyst can 
        Macro level -> Large Audience (Uber started out target White colar workers , later discovered they have to expend broader)
        Micro Level -> Personal level (Building Personas with usage data and validating) 
# - How should I build it
    Product Instrumentaion
      - User exprience
      - Adpating the product to meet challenging area for end users.
# - How is it performing
      - Release validation
      - And troubleshooting issues( You are seeing sudden trouble in conversation rate and what to in)

## Party Analytics -Scenario
You organized a party and invited guests, A friend came and brought two other friends along they have Nice lefy , but the party was not best of experince for him.

# Questions: 
    Do a the Party analytics to another with details story.
  # User-> Guest

                    left
                        -> when :5pm

        - How many friends did each persong bring on an average
        - Difference between person who had fun and who dod not

  # Core objective has to be defined on what you are tracking to aviod data noise
   - It should how many soda do I need to buy
   - Do want the guest to say longer
   - Do want then to have more fun.

# Real life Scenario for 
 Users -> Customers
 Events -> Medium of product Communication
            - Desktop

     # When they did buy the product 
   Optimizing Funnel Metrics, 
     - Identifying point of friction along the funnel Awareness (poor Ad Content,no explanation in vales and benefits) Not Intereted
     - Identifying point of friction along the funnel Interested ->  Not making Decision
         - website issues
         - Company web app not workng on mobile

 - Plan and forecast strategis
    - deciding which platform to adveryise products and decide why that platform will be the best
      (acquiring third party data to undestand behaviour on social media)
       demograph classification

     # Strategies for Optimization:
       - A/B testing and evaluating the ROAS overtime.
   - Channel optimiztion
        - High view, low conversion , A/B Testing (test change in Message content Audience)


## TOOLS and Users Engagement ( Knowing weather a webiste visit resulted purchase)
- Adobe Analytics,Google Analaytics
    # User-> Who are they

## Analyze -> PRODUCT VALUE MOMENTS FOR USERs
    CORE
      - Make things easier for user
      - Perform a task faster
      - cheaper
      - Conviement
   - Idenifying value behaviours -> user get value from your products
   - Identifying when it happens
   # What is VALUE
      - Measuring intagible Product can be sometimes difficult -> using Fuzzy 
         e.g 
            1. Measuring FUn for Video Streaming
              - How many video were watched
              - How much time was spent
            2. Measuring Antiety Medication
              - Completion Rates
              - return users for refill
      - How find Value Moments in Products
            Study Loyal user Behaviour and look for actions that is common among these loyal customer
            Seek to optimize theses value Moment
        E.g: Facebook this discovered that loyal customers would like have 7-10 friends,and which it used to defined the value Moments
            - It went to perform alot testing and optimization A/B testing optimiztion to drive these value moment for its customers 
  # How find Good Value Moments 
  Talk and get feedback from Power
   - Features used in your products, what do you enjoy about the features
   - Fearures never used, and why ?
   - What missing?
   - Which competetion were you comparing against
  Users & from Churn Users
    - What is the value Gap (expensive , )
    - What outcome were you hoping to get
    - Why did you Leave ?
    - What could we have done better to keep you

 # Analytics on the Feedbacks to understand value Mmoments
    - Correlations between loyal customers and Behaviour and Churn Users
     If behaviours shown 
      - Most retained  + Most churn them -> no Correlation
      - Few Retained + Few Churned -> No Corelation
      - Most REtained + Few Churned -> There is Corelation
  
 # Whats Drives retention for your Product -> This is the can be build into a VENN DIAGRAM -> Retained users and Actions taken has an intersection.
      - Find important Actions e.g -> A users added 10 friends is an actions. how many retained users did that.
      - See if retention changes as usage changes
      - Find ideal Frequency of actions 
      -  Find Causation using A/B testing -> determine how changes in to product can cause retentions
         =========
         Examples:
         =========
           - Suggest to add friends Earlier their sign on
           - make add people more prominent
           - Add Tooltips.
  # Guide User to Value Moments -> the main objects to have more retentions
       Cohorts -> A group of users with shared characteristics
       E.g - Users who own ios devices
           - Users who signed up today
       Why should we be looking at Cohorts
         - If user base are changing rapidly
         - DAU and MAU affected by user growth
    Analyzing user engagement vs growth Analysis
      Analyze User segmented by day to for mobile download we can help us understand how install were done in a day over the last 30 days,
      this help us understand retention and churn
