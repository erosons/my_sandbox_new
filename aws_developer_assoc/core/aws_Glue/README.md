1. Clone the Repository Locally:
First, clone the repository to your local machine. This step is typically done outside of AWS Glue.

git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

2. Prepare Your Glue Job:
AWS Glue supports Python and Scala for scripting. You'll need to prepare a script that you will run in your Glue job. This script will include the logic to process data and any custom code from your repository.

3. Upload the Repository to S3:
Upload the necessary files from your repository to an S3 bucket. AWS Glue will access these files from S3.


aws s3 cp /path-to-your-repo/ s3://your-bucket/path-to-your-repo/ --recursive 

Ensure your CLI configuration is up to date

4. Create an AWS Glue Job:
Navigate to the AWS Glue console and create a new Glue job.

Name: Provide a name for your job.
- IAM Role: Select an IAM role that has the necessary permissions to read from S3, write to S3, and execute Glue jobs.
Type: 
- Choose "Spark" or "Python shell" depending on your script.
- Glue version: Choose the Glue version appropriate for your script.
- This job runs: Choose "A new script to be authored by you".

5. Edit the Script:
In the script editor, you can either write your script or upload a script file. 
Make sure to include the S3 paths to your repository files. An example Python script might look like this:


GLue Directory for Custom Class
your-repository/
├── src/
│   └── my_class.py
├── glue_job_script.py

- aws s3 cp src/ s3://your-bucket/path-to-your-repo/src/ --recursive
- aws s3 cp glue_job_script.py s3://your-bucket/path-to-your-repo/glue_job_script.py

### Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Python Packages in AWS Glue
Download the Packages: Download the required packages as .whl files. You can use pip to download these packages locally.

pip download -d /path-to-local-directory package-name
aws s3 cp /path-to-local-directory s3://your-bucket/path-to-packages/ --recursive
