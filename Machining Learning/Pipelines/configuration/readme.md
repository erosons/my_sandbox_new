# Objective: Prepare and simulate the dataset needed for training the generative AI models and testing their outputs.

    Data Collection and Analysis:
        Use Python to analyze existing data pipelines and schemas. Tools like Pandas can be used to load historical logs and configuration data.
        Extract features like throughput, error rates, and configurations from these data.

# Objective: Develop and train a generative model that can suggest optimal data pipeline configurations.

    Using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE):
        Create a VAE model in TensorFlow/Keras that learns to encode different pipeline configurations and can generate new configurations.
        Train the model using historical configuration data as input.

Python Example:

# Objective: Implement the AI model within a simulated environment to generate pipeline configurations and compare with existing setups.

    Simulation Environment Setup:
        Develop a Python script that uses the trained VAE to generate new configurations when given a new data type or schema.
        Implement a basic feedback loop using simulation results to retrain or fine-tune the model.
