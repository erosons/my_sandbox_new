"""
Component testing focuses on testing a group of related
functionalities or a class in isolation, but it might involve
more than one function or method. It tests a component as a whole,
usually with its own internal dependencies mocked or stubbed.
Scenario: Testing a class that performs user authentication by verifying credentials.
The class interacts with a user repository but the repositoryâ€™s behavior is simulated for the test.
