It appears there's an issue preventing the execution of the algorithm in this environment.
However, I can provide you with a detailed explanation of how you could implement Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
in Python to solve the problem locally on your machine.
Uniform-Cost Search is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that is used for traversing a weighted tree or graph
to find the shortest path from a starting node to a goal node. It expands the least-cost node first and is guaranteed 
to find the least-cost path to the goal if the cost of each step exceeds some small positive value.
Here's a Python function for UCS using the PriorityQueue from the queue module:

"""
from queue import PriorityQueue
from typing import String ,List

def uniform_cost_search(graph, start, goal)-> List[int,str] : #->
    # Priority queue to hold the frontier nodes, initialized with the start node
    # Each element in the queue: (cost-so-far, current-node, path-so-far)
    frontier = PriorityQueue()
    # This inititalizes the starting.
    frontier.put((0, start, [start]))  #->  (0,Zerind, [Zerind])
    
    # A set to keep track of visited nodes
    explored = set()

    # Loop until the frontier is empty
    while not frontier.empty():  
        # Get the node in the frontier with the lowest cost-so-far
        cost, node, path = frontier.get_nowait()
        print(cost, node, path)

        # If the node is the goal, return the cost and path
        if node == goal:
            return cost, path

        # If the node has not been visited yet
        if node not in explored:
            explored.add(node)

            # Add neighbors to the frontier with updated costs and paths
            for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in explored:
                    frontier.put((cost + edge_cost, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
 
    # If the goal was never reached in the search
    return float("inf"), []
"""
    You can use the following graph structure to represent the Romania map.
    The graph is a dictionary where each key is a city and each value is a
    list of tuples (neighbor, distance):   
    """
romania_map = {
    # Add the other cities and distances based on your image
