In Databricks, a Pool (formerly known as a Databricks Runtime or Instance Pool)

Refers to a pre-created set of cloud resources that can be used to speed up the provisioning of clusters. The concept behind pools is to reduce the cluster start-up time and provide more efficient resource management, especially when you're running multiple jobs or notebooks that need to scale dynamically.

## Key Features of Pools in Databricks:

    - Faster Cluster Start Times: By maintaining a set of idle instances, pools allow new clusters to start faster since some of the 
       resources  are already provisioned and waiting to be used.

    - Cost Efficiency: Pools help minimize costs associated with cluster start times and auto-scaling by reusing instances across multiple 
       clusters. This efficiency reduces the overhead costs of repeatedly launching new virtual machines.

    - Resource Sharing: Pools allow for sharing of instances across different clusters. This means that when a new cluster is launched, it can 
        utilize instances from the pool rather than waiting for new instances to be provisioned.

    - Customization: Users can specify the instance types, disk type, and other configurations for the resources in the pool. This 
        customization ensures that the pool meets the specific performance and cost requirements of the workload.

   -  Idle Instance Management: Pools can be configured with a minimum and maximum number of instances. Databricks automatically manages the 
        number of idle instances in a pool, scaling down when they are not needed, which helps in controlling costs.

    - Preemption Priority: Pools can be set with different preemption priorities, determining which clusters can preempt resources from  
         others. This setting helps in resource allocation based on the priority of different tasks or jobs.

## Use Cases for Pools:

    - Interactive Analysis: 
    For data scientists and analysts running interactive queries and notebooks, pools can provide quick access to computing resources, allowing for faster experimentation and analysis.

    - Job Scheduling: 
    For automated jobs that run at scheduled times, pools ensure that the necessary resources are immediately available, thus reducing the latency in job start times.

    - Data Engineering Workflows: 
    In data engineering, where pipelines may need to scale up and down frequently, pools help in managing these fluctuations efficiently.
