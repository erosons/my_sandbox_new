<!-- In the context of software versioning, particularly for platforms like Databricks that offer both standard and Long-Term Support (LTS) versions, the difference between a version labeled "15.4 LTS" and "15.4" typically pertains to the support lifecycle and stability of the release. Here’s how these versions generally differ:
15.4 LTS (Long-Term Support) -->

    Extended Support: LTS versions are supported for a longer period than standard versions. This extended support includes security patches, bug fixes, and sometimes minor feature enhancements to ensure the stability and security of the platform over a long period. For Databricks, an LTS version typically has a support lifecycle that lasts several years.
    Stability: LTS releases are focused on stability and reliability, making them ideal for enterprise deployments where frequent upgrades can be disruptive. Organizations choose LTS versions to ensure that their critical operations run smoothly without the need for frequent system updates.
    Update Frequency: While LTS versions receive essential updates, they do not receive all the cutting-edge features that might be introduced in the standard versions. Updates are generally more conservative to avoid introducing instability.

15.4 (Standard Version)

    Shorter Support Lifecycle: Standard versions have a shorter support span compared to LTS versions. Once a new standard version is released, support for older standard versions typically diminishes, except for critical security patches for a limited time.
    Feature Rich: Standard versions are often more feature-rich compared to LTS versions. They incorporate the latest features, improvements, and enhancements more rapidly. This is beneficial for environments where having the latest capabilities is more critical than long-term stability.
    Ideal for Testing and Development: Due to the inclusion of the latest features, standard versions are often used in development and testing environments where teams can benefit from the newest functionalities before they are hardened into an LTS release.

Choosing Between 15.4 LTS and 15.4

    Decision Criteria: The choice between an LTS version and a standard version should be based on the specific needs of the business or project. If you require a stable environment with less frequent changes for production systems, an LTS version like "15.4 LTS" is advisable. If you want to leverage the latest features and improvements and can handle a faster upgrade cycle, then the standard "15.4" would be more suitable.
    Environment Suitability: Production environments, especially those requiring regulatory compliance or handling critical operations, generally favor LTS versions. In contrast, development environments or pilot programs might opt for standard versions to take advantage of new features.

<!-- In summary, the choice between an LTS and a standard version in Databricks or similar platforms hinges on your priorities between stability and long-term support versus having immediate access to the latest features and improvements. -->

        Available from May 2024 until its end-of-support in December 2024.
        Continues with Apache Spark 3.5.0.
        Introduced support for Zstandard compression functions and various bug fixes to enhance stability and performance, particularly in machine learning modules.

Each version is designed with specific features to enhance performance, offer new functionalities, or improve security and stability. LTS versions, such as the 15.4 LTS, provide longer support periods, which are ideal for enterprise environments that require stability over longer timescales.

# provide verbose details: Databricks Runtime 16.0

Databricks Runtime 16.0, released in November 2024, incorporates a variety of new features and enhancements designed to optimize performance and expand functionality, particularly for handling complex data operations and improving machine learning workflows. Here are the key features and changes introduced in this version:

    Enhanced SQL Capabilities:
        New SQL functions like try_url_decode, zeroifnull, and nullifzero have been added to improve data manipulation flexibility.
        Automatic schema evolution is now supported during MERGE operations into Delta tables, facilitating easier schema adjustments over time without manual intervention.

    Machine Learning and Data Science Enhancements:
        The runtime includes an array of updated Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, ensuring compatibility with the latest data science workflows.
        For machine learning, libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and XGBoost are maintained up-to-date, enhancing the runtime's capability to handle diverse ML tasks.

    Performance and Stability Improvements:
        Several under-the-hood adjustments to Apache Spark components and Databricks proprietary optimizations have been incorporated to boost performance and stability.
        Improvements in handling Avro files and enhanced error messages for structured streaming enhance the overall user experience.

    Security and Compliance:
        Updates in Databricks Runtime 16.0 include changes like disabling the installation of libraries from DBFS to increase security. The handling of artifacts across different compute types has been unified, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
