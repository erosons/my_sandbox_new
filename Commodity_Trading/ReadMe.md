# Commodities are typically sorted into four broad categories: 
        - metal, 
        - energy, 
        - livestock and meat, 
        - Agricultural products.
    For investors, commodities can be an important way to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional securities.
    Commodities are considered risky investments because the supply and demand of these products are affected by events that are difficult to predict,
    such as 
        - weather, 
        - epidemics, and 
        - natural and 
        - human-made disasters.
    There are many ways to invest in commodities, including 
        - futures contracts, 
        - Options, and 
        - Exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
