                        <p>Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, 
                            relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper,
                             more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed
                              by communities rather than a single author or company</p>

                        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services, including applications, data storage and data processing, over the internet.
                             You’ll usually pay for cloud computing services on a pay-as-you-go basis, so you pay only for the applications and cloud services you use.
