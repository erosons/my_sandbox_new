Genral Family of VMsizes: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/a-family

# For general all-purpose and job compute in Databricks, I recommend the following VM families:

   # General-Purpose Compute:

        Standard_DS series (Premium SSD): Suitable for workloads requiring low latency and high IOPS.

        Standard_D series (e.g., Standard_D4s_v3): Ideal for general-purpose tasks like web servers, small to medium databases, and development environments.

        Standard_A series: Good for lightweight workloads and testing environments.

   # Job Compute:

        Standard_DS series (Premium SSD): Great for large-scale data processing and ETL jobs that need fast disk performance.

        Standard_NC series (GPU-enabled): Recommended for machine learning and data processing tasks that can benefit from GPU acceleration.

        Standard_M series (Memory-Optimized): Suitable for workloads requiring a large amount of memory, such as in-memory data processing.
        
        Edv4 series in Azure VMs is designed for memory-intensive applications

These VM families provide a balanced mix of CPU, memory, and storage, making them versatile for various Databricks workloads. Would you like more details on any specific VM type or guidance on configuring them?
