Azure Blob Storage:

    General-purpose storage optimized for storing unstructured data such as images, videos, backups, or large binary data (blobs).
    It is suitable for scenarios like serving files for web applications, storing backups, or as a general file repository.

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS): Built on top of Blob Storage but adds a hierarchical namespace.

    Designed specifically for big data analytics. It is built to store massive amounts of data in various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) for analytics workloads.
    ADLS is optimized for scenarios involving big data, such as data lakes, data warehousing, machine learning, and advanced analytics.
